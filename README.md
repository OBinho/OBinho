I'm a React / react native front-end developer, these are some random codes I'm studying mostly through Academind's Udemy class.

Most of the apps I uploaded here are outdated and you can see the difference in my coding taking form as I progress my studies.

Although I plan to keep the first projects raw code intact so I can see my learning curve, future changes must contain a better code structuring and probably some changes in screen proportions.

You are very welcome to comment any tips, as I'm learning most of this by myself your opinion will be kindly appreciated!
